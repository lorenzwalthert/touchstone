\usage{
ref_upsample(ref, n = 20)
}
\value{
A tibble with columns \code{block} and \code{ref}.
}
\description{
A block is a permutation of all unique elements in \code{ref}. Then, we sample
\code{n} blocks. This is better than repeating one sample a certain number of
times because if compute resources steadily increase, the first sample will
always perform worse than the second, so the order within the blocks must be
random.
