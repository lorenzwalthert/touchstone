```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>",
  eval = FALSE
)
```

Start by initializing {touchstone} in your package repository with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
touchstone::use_touchstone()
```

This will:

- create a `touchstone` directory in the repository root with:

  * `config.json` that defines how to run your benchmark. In particular, you can
    define a `benchmarking_repo`, that is, a repository you need to run your bench mark 
    (use `""` if you don't need an additional git repository checked out for your 
    benchmark).
    This repository will be cloned into `benchmarking_path`. For example to benchmark
    {styler}, we format the {here} package with `style_pkg()` that is not part 
    of the {styler} repository, but with the below config, will be located at
    `touchstone/sources/here` during benchmarking. The code you want to 
    benchmark comes from the benchmarked repository, which in our case is the root 
    from where you call `use_touchstone()` and hence does not need to be defined 
    explicitly.
```json
    { 
      "benchmarking_repo": "lorenzwalthert/here", 
      "benchmarking_ref": "ca9c8e69c727def88d8ba1c8b85b0e0bcea87b3f", 
      "benchmarking_path": "touchstone/sources/here", 
      "os": "ubuntu-18.04", 
      "r": "4.0.0", 
      "rspm": "https://packagemanager.rstudio.com/all/__linux__/bionic/291" 
    }
```
  * `script.R`, the script that runs the benchmark, also called the `touchstone_script`.
  * `header.R`, the script containing the default PR comment header, see `?touchstone::pr_comment`.
  * `footer.R`, the script containing the default PR comment footer, see `?touchstone::pr_comment`.
  
- add the `touchstone` directory to `.Rbuildignore`.
- write the workflow files^[Note that these files must be committed to the default branch before
{touchstone} continuous benchmarking will be triggered for new PRs.] you need to
  invoke touchstone in new pull requests into `.github/workflows/`. 

Now you just need to modify `script.R` to run the benchmarks you are interested in. 

## script.R

The file consists of three parts, two of which you will need to modify to fit your needs. Within the GitHub Action {touchstone} will always run the `script.R` from the `HEAD` branch, so you can modify or extend the benchmarks if needed to fit your current branch. Please beware that a few 
functions such as `refs_install()`, `pin_assets` or `benchmark_run_ref()` will 
perform local git checkouts and therefore the git status should be clean and no 
other processes should run in the directory.


The touchstone script will be run with `run_script()` on GitHub Actions with the
required environment variables `GITHUB_HEAD_REF` and GITHUB_BASE_REF` set for 
various reasons explained in the help file. If you want to interactively work
on your touchstone script, i.e. running it line by line, you must activate
touchstone first with `activate()`, which sets environment variables, R options
and library paths.

### Setup

We first install the different package versions in separate libraries with `refs_install()`, this is mandatory for any `script.R`. If you want to access some directory or file which only exists on one of the branches you can use `pin_assets(..., ref = "your-branch-name")` to make them available across branches. You can of course also run arbitrary code to prepare for the benchmarks. 

```{r}
touchstone::refs_install() # installs branches to benchmark
touchstone::pin_assets("data/all.Rdata", "inst/scripts") # pin files and directories

load(path_pinned_asset("all.Rdata")) # perform other setup you need for the benchmarks
source(path_pinned_asset("scripts/prepare.R"))
data_clean <- prepare_data(data_all)
```

### Benchmarks

Run any number of benchmarks, with one named benchmark per call of `benchmark_run_ref()`. As benchmarks are run in a subprocess, setup (like setting a seed) needs to be passed with `expr_before_benchmark`. You can pass a single function call or a longer block of code wrapped in "{ }". The expressions are captured with `rlang` so you can use [quasiquotation](https://rlang.r-lib.org/reference/quasiquotation.html).

```{r}
# benchmark a function call from your package
touchstone::benchmark_run_ref(
  random_test = yourpkg::fun(data_clean),
  n = 2
)

# Optionally run setup code
touchstone::benchmark_run_ref(
  expr_before_benchmark = {
    library(yourpkg)
    set.seed(42)
  },
  test_with_seed = fun(data_clean),
  n = 2
)
```

### Analyze

This part is just one call to `benchmarks_analyze()`which analyses the results and prepares the PR comment.

```{r} 
# create artifacts used downstream in the GitHub Action
touchstone::benchmarks_analyze()
```


## Running the script

After you have committed and pushed the workflow files to your default branch 
the benchmarks will be run on new pull requests and on each commit while that 
pull request is open.

Note that various functions such as `refs_install()` `pin_assets()` and 
`benchmark_run_ref()` will check out different branches
and should therefore be the only process running in the directory and with a clean
git status.


## The Results

When the GitHub Action successfully completes, the main result you will see is the comment posted on the pull request, it will look something like this:

![](../man/figures/screenshot-pr-comment.png)

You can change the header and footer, see `?touchstone::pr_comment`. The main body is the list of benchmarks and their results. First the mean elapsed time of all iterations of that benchmark (BASE $\rightarrow$ HEAD) and a 95% confidence interval.

To make it easier to spot benchmarks that need closer attention, we prefix the benchmarks with emojis indicating if there was a statistically significant change (see [inference](https://lorenzwalthert.github.io/touchstone/articles/inference.html)) in the timing or not. In this example the HEAD version of `func1` is significantly faster, `func3` is slower than BASE while there is no significant change for `func2`.

The GitHub Action will also upload this text and plots of the timings as artifacts.
